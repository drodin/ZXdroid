libspectrum 0.5.0.1
===================

libspectrum is a library which is designed to make the input and
output of ZX Spectrum emulator files slightly easier than it would be
otherwise. It should hopefully compile and run on Unix-based systems,
Win32 and Mac OS X.

Currently supported are:

* Snapshots: .z80, .szx, .sna (all read/write), .zxs, .sp., .snp and
  +D snapshots (read only).
* Tape images: .tzx, .tap, .spc, .sta and .ltp (read/write) and
  Warajevo .tap, Z80Em and CSW version 1 (read only).
* Input recordings: .rzx (read/write).
* Disk images: .dsk (both plain and extended), .fdi, .sad, .scl, .td0,
  .trd and .udi (identification only).
* Timex cartridges: .dck (read only).
* IDE hard disk images: .hdf (read/write).
* Microdrive cartridge images: .mdr (read/write).

On Unix and Mac OS X, compiling libspectrum should just be as easy as

$ ./configure
$ make

and then `make install' should install it in `/usr/local' ready for
use on your system. If you want to install it somewhere other than
`/usr/local', give the `--prefix=DIR' option to `configure' to install
it under `DIR'. Once installed, some work will probably be necessary
to ensure that the linker can find libspectrum. Either read the
instructions printed when you do `make install' or ask your local
guru.

For details on the functions available, see `doc/libspectrum.txt'.

Compiling from Subversion
-------------------------

If you're using version of libspectrum from Subversion rather than one
of the released tarballs, you'll need to run `autogen.sh' before
running 'configure' for the first time.
